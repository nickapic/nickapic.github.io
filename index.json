The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.\nSwitch is what connects the devices with a ethernet cable connected to all the devices in the network.\nTo do a network Wirelessly you can use a router\nTo have communication in this network they must speak the same language This language is called protocols all the devices agree on protocols. So all the network hardware are made on these protocols. Like Http, Smtp, Tcp, etc.\nNetwork connects devices you can call them Nodes .Nodes also contain stuff that control network so stuff like router and switches and also end points and hosts (Send and receive data)\nNetwork come in many different sizes -When its less Nodes connected together its called a SOHO network. |Switch can also be called HUB| But hubs are old technology and don\u0026rsquo;t confuse them together\nEnterprise Network are networks contain a lot of nodes and basically the network between a company\nLAN - Local Area Network ,Can be a SOHO network and a Enterprise Network can have a lot of these LANs connected together.\nWAN- Are networks connected together over a huge distance .Like maybe a banks network .And Enterprise networks.\nLayer 1 : Physical The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device and a physical transmission medium. It converts the digital bits into electrical, radio, or optical signals. Layer specifications define characteristics such as voltage levels, the timing of voltage changes, physical data rates, maximum transmission distances, modulation scheme, channel access method and physical connectors. This includes the layout of pins, voltages, line impedance, cable specifications, signal timing and frequency for wireless devices. Bit rate control is done at the physical layer and may define transmission mode as simplex, half duplex, and full duplex. The components of a physical layer can be described in terms of a network topology. Physical layer specifications are included in the specifications for the ubiquitous Bluetooth, Ethernet, and USB standards. An example of a less well-known physical layer specification would be for the CAN standard.\nLayer 2 : Data Link The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer—a link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.\nIEEE 802 divides the data link layer into two sublayers:[20]\n  Medium access control (MAC) layer – responsible for controlling how devices in a network gain access to a medium and permission to transmit data.\n  Logical link control (LLC) layer – responsible for identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols, and controls error checking and frame synchronization.\n  The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link layer protocol that can operate over several different physical layers, such as synchronous and asynchronous serial lines.\n   The ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables), includes a complete data link layer that provides both error correction and flow control by means of a selective-repeat sliding-window protocol.\n    Security, specifically (authenticated) encryption, at this layer can be applied with MACSec\n   Layer 3 : Network The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences (called packets) from one node to another connected in \u0026ldquo;different networks\u0026rdquo;. A network is a medium to which many nodes can be connected, on which every node has an address and which permits nodes connected to it to transfer messages to other nodes connected to it by merely providing the content of a message and the address of the destination node and letting the network find the way to deliver the message to the destination node, possibly routing it through intermediate nodes. If the message is too large to be transmitted from one node to another on the data link layer between those nodes, the network may implement message delivery by splitting the message into several fragments at one node, sending the fragments independently, and reassembling the fragments at another node. It may, but does not need to, report delivery errors.\nMessage delivery at the network layer is not necessarily guaranteed to be reliable; a network layer protocol may provide reliable message delivery, but it need not do so.\nA number of layer-management protocols, a function defined in the management annex, ISO 7498/4, belong to the network layer. These include routing protocols, multicast group management, network-layer information and error, and network-layer address assignment. It is the function of the payload that makes these belong to the network layer, not the protocol that carries them.[21]\n","permalink":"https://nickapic.github.io/posts/networking/","summary":"Introduction- A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications.

Attack Summary : Here we have the basic summary of the attack and how we managed to compromise the Machines but more on a basic /simple level as we don\u0026rsquo;t wanna have too put too many details for the executives we do a more detailed and through report in the Vulnerability assessment. Vulnerabilites Found Graph : Here we provide the employers with a graph that can summarize the vulnerabilites in each category like the diagrams like this :  Resources that can be used to make graphs :\nhttps://www.rapidtables.com/tools/bar-graph.html\nhttps://spark.adobe.com/make/charts/bar-graph/\nhttps://www.visme.co/graph-maker/\nSecurity Strengths and Weaknesses : Then in these two sections we basically summarize the Security Strengths of the Organization like if they caught one of your attack, or maybe there is a firewall in place which made the process hard you can compliment annd metnion them here and then in the weaknesses it could be that no one in the company found out there was an attack being carried out , nno two factor authentication in place , etc.  You can also use a diffrent approach and grade your clients Security out of a scale like maybe out of 1-10 or a scale you define.\nVulnerability Report This is the report we go into more technical details about all the vulnerabilities we gathered and this sections we try to divide by hosts/network sections of the organisation as well like for example and first we can organise and write all the vulnerabilities about machines divided into their own sections. So lets say for example we can have it like so :\nIn our example case lets assume we have two network sections( CORP, ACME.LOCAL) and in those we have two machines ( Machine 1 and Machine2 ) then we can classify it like so :\nCORP Network\nGeneral Idea about how you got into the network\nMachine 1 :\nVulnerabilities in this system .\nACME.LOCAL\nMachine 2 :\nVulnerabilities in this system.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can describe these vulnerabilities and provide specifications about them for example lets choose :\nInput Validation Error in the login form which causes SQLi\nNow to Describe this would be great if you can provide as much technical information about this vulnerability as possible and where its caused and if you have access to the source code you can point out the the errors directly in the source code.\nFor our Example :\n SQLi attack due to poor input validation in login form →\nThis error happens due to no sanitisation done on the server side and even client side which leads the login form being a place where malicious actors can place malicious payloads and dump the organisation\u0026rsquo;s database and get sensitive information.\nRisk : Possible Risk of Sensitive Data Disclosure due to SQL Injection attack which can lead to GDPR fines causing a huge financial impact on the organisation.\nImpact Level : Very High\nLikelihood : Very Likely\nVulnerable Piece of Code :\n/*Here you can show the Vulnerable code if you have access to the source code */\n Remediation Summary This is a place where you can give an overall summary of the actions needed to fix for the system at first like if there is a weak password policy in place, no anit viruses in place etc they can be addressed at first, and then we can go into more about fixes about each and every vulnerability in the system i personally go over them in the same order i defined the sections in the Vulnerability Section for this , if you have compromised something using a Metasploit module you can look up patches on that exploit, module or you can search the name of the vulnerability and look for patches from the vendor.\nIf the vulnerability is more about Web exploitation you can use OWASP Guides to make suggestions for the organization and tell them to treat this as a guide for development to avoid mistakes in development, also if its stuff that is popular like shellshock you can look up patches and so on and in some cases you can try providing improved code snippets of the vulnerable piece of code in the system and the same can be done for Buffer Overflows and fixing the vulnerable/defected part of the web app or app in general.\nYou can also provide soluitions / applications that help such issues like in case of a node js application you can recommend some packages to help fix issues in the webapp.\nIn this stage you can also provide an estimated budget the company would need to fix these issues.\nResources and Sources Used :\nLogo : From the “Jujutsu Kaisen” anime promo video | Photo credit: TOHO animation\n","permalink":"https://nickapic.github.io/posts/reportwritting/","summary":"For Report Writing first of all we gotta choose a template i chose the template from this repository here :\nTemplate for Report Writting\nand this will help us write Report in Markdown and to set this up i highly recommend watching the Video from John Hammond who explains the note taking and using this template in a very nice way:\nVideo on how to set the template up\nAnd now lets look at the composition of a Report :","title":"Professional Report Writting"},{"content":"What it is ?
