It identifies websites with publicly accessible .git repositories. It checks if the .git/HEAD file contains refs/heads\nThe gitdumper tool can be used to download as much as possible from the found .git repository from webservers which do not have directory listing enabled. This is what we will use in our case to solve this box.\nThe extractor is script to extract commits and their content from a broken repository.\nThis script tries to recover incomplete git repositories:\n Iterate through all commit-objects of a repository Try to restore the contents of the commit Commits are not sorted by date  Soo lets start using our gitdumper tool to dump the publicly accessible .git directory and to use this command here we can use :\n./gitdumper.sh \u0026lt;ip\u0026gt;/.git . and this will dump the private git directory for us in the current directory and also this is gonna be hidden as its the git directory so we can use all the git commands on it and we can traverse into the directory and use commands like git log and see all the commits done and lets scroll down to the bottom and we find the Initial Commit and use its SHA1 hash\nand now we can use this SHA1 hashes next to commit we wanna see and we can use the command\ngit show 2f423697bf81fe5956684f66fb6fc6596a1903cc and we can show the whole commit and all the files in that commit there\nand there you go we can see the password which is the flag here and again if you find this as a bug bounty you can report and its gonna be a pretty good payout for that because this will let us track all the code and all sensitive information in the commits if there ever was something.\n","permalink":"https://nickapic.github.io/posts/githacking/","summary":"So to enumerate over .git folder and also to dump them to your desktop and stuff we use tools from this repository GitTools and we can just git clone this repositry and use all the tool and the guides for them are given in the repo.\nBut in general we can use gitfinder tool to find websites with their .git repository available to the public.

then go to the terminal traverse to the download directory and then do\ndpkg -i Nessusfilename and then we type in the path it gives us in the terminal again like shown below\nSo we start nessus by doing /etc/init.d/nessusd start\nand then we go to our browser and go to the the page kali:8834\nand then we can install tool by signing up and stuff like that and it should like like something like this after its done installing and everything.\nThis is the free dition which allows us to scan any private IP address and we can scan 15 of these so class A to class C cant scan an external ip tho.\nYou can schedule Scans here and every thing\nWe can then go to the discovery tab and select what ports we wanna scan so like all of them or some of them that are defined in the program and then also in the assesment tab we can scan for diffrent types like Scan for all known web Vulnerablities,Scan for all web vulnerabilites and stuff like that .\nIts kind of a slow scan btw it takes a while to do and its preety through.\nIn the new scan tab we have a lot of types of scans like\nMalware Scans,Ransomware Scans ,Mobile Device Scan,Advanced Scan\nThe most common ones though would be basic and advanced scan\nSo after our scan is complete we can go to it and check all the vulnerabilites listed in their like below-\nWe can export these list of Vulnerablities by clicking the export button and we can get nessus document which we can then convert to excel and put in our report .\nResource and places to learn more :  Nessus : https://tryhackme.com/room/rpnessusredux The Cyber Mentor :

:\nTemplate for Report Writting\nand this will help us write Report in Markdown and to set this up i highly recommend watching the Video from John Hammond who explains the note taking and using this template in a very nice way:\nVideo on how to set the template up\nAnd now lets look at the composition of a Report :\n Introduction Executive Summary Reporting Summary (Technical) Remediation Summary  Introduction For the Introduction Part you can use examples from a few templates and edit them This Section Basically covers information and summary of what task you are given, the Confidentiality Statement so stuff like who has access to this, A disclaimer, and then an Assessment Overview where we basically define the date from which we will be doing the assessment, the activities in a very General Form like Planning, Discovery, Attack, Reporting.\nNext in this section, we define the criteria we will be evaluating the system by for example if you are giving a Risk Value for each Vulnerability you can write how you would evaluate that like what is Low Risk, What is a medium risk, and so on and how are you classifying so like are you using a generic low → Medium → High scale or something else you can also use a standard like CVE-Scores to define your Risk Values and state them here.\nFor getting an example on this i would highly recommend checking out this repository from The Cyber Mentor who has a sample report again that report will also give you a very good idea of what a report should consist of.\nThen a small summary of the scope we were allocated and our task should also be included in a section called scope.\nResources :\nTemplate → https://github.com/hmaverickadams/TCM-Security-Sample-Pentest-Report\nExecutive Summary This part is what consists of us basically summarizing the whole Assessment for the higher ups they don\u0026rsquo;t really care about the specifics of the exploits but they want to know for example lets say how is the overall security looking like, what would be the cost to fix everything up and the number of vulnerabilities (We will have graphs and stuff for that) and now lets try to break this down in sections :\n Introduction and Summary of the Report : This is a short summary basically summarizing stuff like since when and what time Time Period the assessment was carried and if we were able to compromise the machines and if we have completed the targets that were set in the Rules of Engagement. Attack Summary : Here we have the basic summary of the attack and how we managed to compromise the Machines but more on a basic /simple level as we don\u0026rsquo;t wanna have too put too many details for the executives we do a more detailed and through report in the Vulnerability assessment. Vulnerabilites Found Graph : Here we provide the employers with a graph that can summarize the vulnerabilites in each category like the diagrams like this :  Resources that can be used to make graphs :\nhttps://www.rapidtables.com/tools/bar-graph.html\nhttps://spark.adobe.com/make/charts/bar-graph/\nhttps://www.visme.co/graph-maker/\nSecurity Strengths and Weaknesses : Then in these two sections we basically summarize the Security Strengths of the Organization like if they caught one of your attack, or maybe there is a firewall in place which made the process hard you can compliment annd metnion them here and then in the weaknesses it could be that no one in the company found out there was an attack being carried out , nno two factor authentication in place , etc.  You can also use a diffrent approach and grade your clients Security out of a scale like maybe out of 1-10 or a scale you define.\nVulnerability Report This is the report we go into more technical details about all the vulnerabilities we gathered and this sections we try to divide by hosts/network sections of the organisation as well like for example and first we can organise and write all the vulnerabilities about machines divided into their own sections. So lets say for example we can have it like so :\nIn our example case lets assume we have two network sections( CORP, ACME.LOCAL) and in those we have two machines ( Machine 1 and Machine2 ) then we can classify it like so :\nCORP Network\nGeneral Idea about how you got into the network\nMachine 1 :\nVulnerabilities in this system .\nACME.LOCAL\nMachine 2 :\nVulnerabilities in this system.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can describe these vulnerabilities and provide specifications about them for example lets choose :\nInput Validation Error in the login form which causes SQLi\nNow to Describe this would be great if you can provide as much technical information about this vulnerability as possible and where its caused and if you have access to the source code you can point out the the errors directly in the source code.\nFor our Example :\n SQLi attack due to poor input validation in login form →\nThis error happens due to no sanitisation done on the server side and even client side which leads the login form being a place where malicious actors can place malicious payloads and dump the organisation\u0026rsquo;s database and get sensitive information.\nRisk : Possible Risk of Sensitive Data Disclosure due to SQL Injection attack which can lead to GDPR fines causing a huge financial impact on the organisation.\nImpact Level : Very High\nLikelihood : Very Likely\nVulnerable Piece of Code :\n/*Here you can show the Vulnerable code if you have access to the source code */\n Remediation Summary This is a place where you can give an overall summary of the actions needed to fix for the system at first like if there is a weak password policy in place, no anit viruses in place etc they can be addressed at first, and then we can go into more about fixes about each and every vulnerability in the system i personally go over them in the same order i defined the sections in the Vulnerability Section for this , if you have compromised something using a Metasploit module you can look up patches on that exploit, module or you can search the name of the vulnerability and look for patches from the vendor.\nIf the vulnerability is more about Web exploitation you can use OWASP Guides to make suggestions for the organization and tell them to treat this as a guide for development to avoid mistakes in development, also if its stuff that is popular like shellshock you can look up patches and so on and in some cases you can try providing improved code snippets of the vulnerable piece of code in the system and the same can be done for Buffer Overflows and fixing the vulnerable/defected part of the web app or app in general.\nYou can also provide soluitions / applications that help such issues like in case of a node js application you can recommend some packages to help fix issues in the webapp.\nIn this stage you can also provide an estimated budget the company would need to fix these issues.\nResources and Sources Used :\nLogo : From the “Jujutsu Kaisen” anime promo video | Photo credit: TOHO animation\n","permalink":"https://nickapic.github.io/posts/reportwritting/","summary":"For Report Writing first of all we gotta choose a template i chose the template from this repository here :\nTemplate for Report Writting\nand this will help us write Report in Markdown and to set this up i highly recommend watching the Video from John Hammond who explains the note taking and using this template in a very nice way:\nVideo on how to set the template up\nAnd now lets look at the composition of a Report :","title":"Professional Report Writting"}]
